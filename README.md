# Benz----ErosinCamera

This project is a current research project that I am working on with a team of students. We want to be able to analyze the erosion of shorelines based on a sequence of images taken over time. The goal is to connect a camera to a RaspberryPi, have that camera take pictures at certain intervals, and then send those images back to a server using cellular data. The project invloves researching the right camera to purchase, understanding what software to work with in order to have the Pi effectively communicate with the camera, and then developing the code to carry out the necessary functions. The code involces having the camera take images in invervals and then sending those images to the server. Further down the line, we hope to be able to implement AI to analyze the images taken and measure the ammount of erosion on shorelines.
